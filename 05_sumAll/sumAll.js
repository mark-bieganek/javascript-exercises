const sumAll = function() {

};

/*
Implement a function that takes 2 integers and returns the sum of every
number between(and including) them:

```javascript
sumAll(1, 4) // returns the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 which is 10
```

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Get the sum of two integers.
2. As integers, the numbers should not have a fractional component,
    and don't support decimal points.

ALGORITHM:
# Create a way to remember the result of our operations.
# Check the first two inputs.
    # If input is not a number, assign it a default value of 0.
    # Otherwise, convert input to integer.
    # Add these inputs. Store the result.
# Output the result.
